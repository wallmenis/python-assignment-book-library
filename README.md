### PYTHON MULTI-LIBRARY MANAGER

This bit of 2000 lines of python is written as an assignment for my python class.

It is meant to be both a front and back end for a python book library manager.

It has 2 user types:

- An admin and

- a user.

The admin has various management options such as deleting and adding books for the libraries that he manages.

They can change any attributes they might need on the books.


The user can have favorites on their books and place orders from specific bookstores.
